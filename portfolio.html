        <p class="welcome">
          I am a Software Development Graduate who recently completed a course in Computing with Web Development who has gained a
          strong foundation in software, web and application development and programming principles.
          <br>
          With many years experience in hospitality and customer service, I have proven to be an energetic,
          confident and socialable individual. Most recently, I have been manufacturing ICU
          ventilators and office administration work.
          <br>
          Having enjoyed continuing my studies through online courses, making websites for friends and recently joining
          a volunteer hacktivist group, I have benefited from each of these side projects greatly and am looking forward
          to putting my skills and knowledge into practice in a professional setting.

      <p>Chew some gum. Studies have shown that we can reduce a significant amount of stress by chewing gum. Pop a stick
        of that winter fresh if you’re just not feeling calm in the moment.</p>

      <p>Evaluate how much this matters. Think about how much your problem matters in the grand scheme of things. Will
        it still affect you a year from now? Does it even help to be so hard on yourself? If you made it out alive,
        chances are you’ll find a way to get through it and move on to more happiness and hardships.</p>

      <p>Do what your grandma would do. By the time we’re much older, we usually don’t get so worried when things don’t
        go our way, because we get used to it. Think of how your grandma would react in a situation and do that. She’d
        probably say something funny and then move on to the next thing, which is really the best thing to do if you
        want to stay sane.</p>
