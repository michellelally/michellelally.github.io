    <!-- <h1>You'll <u>never</u> believe how chill it is!</h1>
        <p>The chill zone is where all the things are copacetic. Think about all the unchill things in your life. Think about them, just for a moment. And now? Just forget about 'em. Why? Because, my friend: you've just entered the <em>Chill Zone</em>. The following passages of text are pulled from this <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Be-Chill">wikiHow article</a>.</p>

      <h2>Welcome to my portfolio</h2>

      <p>Do your own thing, and let others do theirs. If they're not hurting anyone, what's the problem? Chill people
        don't look for reasons or opportunities to hate on others just for being different. There's no reason to bully
        or tread on other people's territory. Try to be happy with yourself and encourage self-love in others, too and
        remember be yourself.</p>

      <p>Unless someone is rude to you, your day should go by smoothly by being polite, considerate, and nice. Chill
        people don't antagonize for the sake of it or stir up a bunch of negative emotions by being jerks; chill people
        are generally kind and get along well with others. However, try to avoid going overboard so you don't become a
        people-pleaser or pushover.</p>

      <p>Don't sweat the small stuff. Take your life in stride. Roll with the punches and be accepting of the little
        things life throws your way, reserving your passion for what matters to you most. This is pretty much the
        defining feature of a chill person.</p>

      <p>Chew some gum. Studies have shown that we can reduce a significant amount of stress by chewing gum. Pop a stick
        of that winter fresh if you’re just not feeling calm in the moment.</p>

      <p>Evaluate how much this matters. Think about how much your problem matters in the grand scheme of things. Will
        it still affect you a year from now? Does it even help to be so hard on yourself? If you made it out alive,
        chances are you’ll find a way to get through it and move on to more happiness and hardships.</p>

      <p>Do what your grandma would do. By the time we’re much older, we usually don’t get so worried when things don’t
        go our way, because we get used to it. Think of how your grandma would react in a situation and do that. She’d
        probably say something funny and then move on to the next thing, which is really the best thing to do if you
        want to stay sane.</p>
